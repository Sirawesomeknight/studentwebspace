	<p id="content">StudentSources is an application that attempts to combine all the homework websites into one. By downloading our various packages you can get all your favorite site notifications, due dates, attachments, and other features through one useful uniform place. StudentSources was created and developed by Sirawesomeknight at the Francis W Parker School in order to solve the problem of having different teachers having different sites. Since then it evolved into a more general organization site aiming to achieve ultimate website organization</p>

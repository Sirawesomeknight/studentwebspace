	<p id="post">First Post<br>11/7/2014<br><br>Well finally. A working page that can possibly be used for the student body. It still has some refining to do such as the color scheme, crisper animations, more efficient document setup, etc. etc. That will come in Prototype 3. There is still a lot of work to be done, however this is the last hardcore work day for awhile. I am finding that I don't have all the time in the world to develop this, and that I would like to do some more of creating my video game: Survival at the Dance Party. I will still do a fair amount of work each week, however the increase in updates will decline. In one week we went from prototype 1 which was a mishmash of colors and iframes, to this site. Development is going good, and I have decided as of now that I will not be having any co-developers yet. GET FIRED UP FOR THE NEWEST UPDATES</p>

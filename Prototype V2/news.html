	<p id="post">Development Slowdown<br>11/16/2014<br><br>Development has been going so slow I don't know if the website will ever be done. 2 hours a week just isn't enough so I may have to boost it up to three. However, I have different projects that have a due date that need attention as well. StudentSources does not have a due date and never will have one. However, I want to propose this idea to Mr. Ruggiero by the end of the 2014-2015 school year. This week the general layout of the actual website was made. I may have to refine it a little bit because I want to incorperate tools into there somehow. Like if there is a math assignment, a calculator will pop up on the screen. Something tells me I may need someone to do styling. As of right now tottenhamjm seems to be the best canidate for the job, as he is the most interested out of everyone that I am thinking. I don't think I can do styling, but I can definitely do layout. Styling meaning... colors and stuff. Maybe I don't need someone who knows how to program to do it. If I have someone else do the styling then everything should be all good. I did estimated funding this week as well. I will get more into finance type stuff later. Development is slow, but that is just a decrease in time committment.</p>

	<p id="post">First Post<br>11/7/2014<br><br>Well finally. A working page that can possibly be used for the student body. It still has some refining to do such as the color scheme, crisper animations, more efficient document setup, etc. etc. That will come in Prototype 3. There is still a lot of work to be done, however this is the last hardcore work day for awhile. I am finding that I don't have all the time in the world to develop this, and that I would like to do some more of creating my video game: Survival at the Dance Party. I will still do a fair amount of work each week, however the increase in updates will decline. In one week we went from prototype 1 which was a mishmash of colors and iframes, to this site. Development is going good, and I have decided as of now that I will not be having any co-developers yet. GET FIRED UP FOR THE NEWEST UPDATES</p>
